The project involved analyzing Reddit users' posts. After loading and exploring the data, text preprocessing was performed using NLTK. A deep learning model with an LSTM layer was built using Keras for text classification based on user posts. The model was trained and evaluated, achieving a test accuracy of approximately 40%. The project utilized data visualization, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques
